Case Study: Retail Sales Demand Forecasting
==============

This repository contains my code (.ipynb Python Jupyter Notebook files) for
investigating and performing analyses on retail sales data from Germany,
Austria, and France. The goal is to better understand the effect of media
advertising and in-store activations through special events. In addition, I
need to ensure to make pricing decisions that maximize margin. Two critical
outcomes will be to provide correlations with promotions and sales along with
forecasting sales for future months.

Language: Python 3.6.X
Medium: Ananconda Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files)
Database: Microsoft Azure SQL Database (or should I use a SQlite database or none at all??)

Within the repository, there are 6 files besides this README file.

    - article_master.txt (data file)
    - sales.txt (data file)
    - RetailSales_DemandForecasting_McRoberts.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook Python file)
    - FilterNoisyGPSdata_McRoberts.html (Jupyter Notebook exported to HTML)
    - FilterNoisyGPSdata_McRoberts.py (Jupyter Notebook exported to .py)
    - Retail Case Study_lean.pptx (powerpoint file with overview and tasks)

The Jupyter Notebook file was used for development. Use for evaluating
and running code cell by cell.
