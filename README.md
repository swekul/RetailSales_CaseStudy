Case Study: Retail Sales Demand Forecasting
==============

This repository contains my code (.ipynb Python Jupyter Notebook files) for
investigating and performing analyses on retail sales data from Germany,
Austria, and France. The goal is to better understand the effect of two
promotion types: media advertising and in-store activations through special
events. In addition, I need to ensure to make pricing decisions that maximize
margin. Two critical outcomes will be to provide correlations with promotions
and sales along with forecasting sales for future months.

Language: Python 3.6.X

Development Environment: Ananconda Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files)

Within the repository, there are 7 files besides this README file.

    - article_master.txt (data file)
    - sales.txt (data file)
    - RetailSales_CaseStudy.pptx (powerpoint file with overview and tasks)
    - RetailSales_DemandForecasting_McRoberts.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook Python file)
    - FilterNoisyGPSdata_McRoberts.html (Jupyter Notebook exported to HTML)
    - FilterNoisyGPSdata_McRoberts.py (Jupyter Notebook exported to .py)
    - RetailSales_Results_McRoberts.pptx (powerpoint file with my results)

The Jupyter Notebook file was used for development. Use for evaluating
and running code cell by cell. The two instances of machine learning via
SKLearn Pipelines take more than 30 minutes to run (depending on computing
power).
